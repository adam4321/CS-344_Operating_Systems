# OSU cs-344 Spring 2020

Small Python project where three files are created with 10 character strings
and are set to not append when the file is run again. Then two random numbers
are generated and then printed to stdout along with their sum. The assignment
is meant to be short and simple, but must be met 100% to get any points and
no help or discussion is allowed.
