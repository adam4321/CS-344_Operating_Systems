# Oregon State University CS-344 Spring 2020 Operating Systems

This repository contains five UNIX operating systems projects.
The first is a BASH script witch contains four callable functions
for processing matrices. The second is an adventure game in c, which
generates a random graph of rooms and then allows the user to
navigate the map. The third is a stripped down CLI in c. The fourth
is a client and server, which uses a one time pad to encrypt and
decrypt plain text messages.
