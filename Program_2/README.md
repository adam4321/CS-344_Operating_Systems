# OSU CS-344 Program 2

This project is a pair of c programs, where the first program (buildrooms.c) will create a new directory with a random set of seven room files in it, from a list of eight possible room names. Then, the second program (adventure.c) will search the for the most recent directory and load those room files, to allow the user to play a simple maze game.
